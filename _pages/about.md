Hi, I'm Qi Zheng! I am a graduate student in [National Anti-counterfeit Engineering Research Center](http://bmal.hust.edu.cn/sysjs.htm), supervised by [Xinge You](http://bmal.hust.edu.cn/EN.htm), Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China. I also obtained my Becholer degree in the Department of Information Engineering at HUST in 2016, supervised by [Wei Yuan](http://bmal.hust.edu.cn/info/1005/1057.htm).

My current research interests include computer vision and machine learning.
